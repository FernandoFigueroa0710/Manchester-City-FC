# [Manchester City FC](https://manchester-city-fc.herokuapp.com)

Manchester City FC is a static webpage as a homage to the English Soccer club from the premier league. This project was possible with the aid of a [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-react-practice-course-learn-by-building-projects/) for the layout, inspiration and deeply understanding of the power and functionality of React as a library

## What have I leaned on this project?

- The MVC model architecture for React
- The creation and implementation of High Order Components (HOC) in React
- The creation and implementation of reusable components and functions in React
- Complex animations and transitions using:
  [React Move](https://react-move.js.org/#/)<br/>
  [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/)<br/>
  [d3-ease](https://d3js.org/)<br/>
- Using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) to make the page look better and create HOC and reusable components
- Creating Routes to effectively navigate the application
- Create Authentication to create an admin endpoint
- Create an Admin dashboard, performing CRUD operations
- Create a submit and update form within the same component
- The use of authentication to protect routes
- The use of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a database and image store for images upload
- Effective communication with Firebase database to perform CRUD operations
- Deployment of Static web app with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
